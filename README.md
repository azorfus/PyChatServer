# PyChatServer
A (simple) python based server client chat system with threading. 

I've added file transfer feature, the client opens up a new TCP connection on a unique port given to it for downloading files from the server. 
I know its not a realistic method but what does it matter when the code is meant to used locally in closed work groups.

Should be useful for sending files around in computers on a local network. Saves time taken to copy files to a drive and to move them around :P
